A simple Python script to guess which word should be in wordle.

Currently it's in simulation mode. You would need to change it a bit to function as required.
It was made as an experiment, so don't expect good code quality. Sorry about that.


When launching the app it will display the word to enter in wordly.
After entering it you will need to write information to the app:

Positions (starting from 0) of which letter are correct (if none, just press enter) (positions needs to be seperated by comma).
Incorrect possitions (usally displayed by yellow) (seperated by comma).
Currect letters (letters, that are green and yellow) (seperated by comma).
Incorrect letters (blacked out letters, that are incorrect) (seperated by comma).

After filling this information it will display another word you need to enter. Repeat this action till you get the correct word.
